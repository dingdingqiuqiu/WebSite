# Exercises of the mind

Physical exercise is important for one's health, and the necessity of mental exercise hasn't been overlooked either. Many kinds of puzzles have been shown to benefit mental health.

**Short-term memory**                                                                                                                                               
Certain puzzles that require you to remember details help improve your short-term memory. Jigsaws, which require you to remember colors and shapes, are a great example.

**Whole brain strength**																																					
Some puzzles require some right-brain creativity in order to think outside the box. But left-brain logic is needed for processing puzzles as well. Riddles and other puzzles help bring the whole brain together to work toward a goal.

**Relaxation**
When working puzzles, people may often experience an improved mood and better concentration. This is caused by a chemical that is produced in the brain when people are engaged with puzzles. But be aware that childish or extremely challenging puzzles don't have the same results.

**Prevents Alzheimer's**
Active brains are less likely to develop brain plaques,which are linked to Alzheimer's disease. This benefit
requires mental activity from an early age,though-so start those puzzles now!

**overlook** v.
A busy lifestyle makes people overlook warning signals regarding their own health.
If we keep overlooking the impact of global warming, we'll be facing severe consequences.

**logic** [U]n.
Composing music not only requires musical talent, but also strong logic. 
Even though the speaker was quite eloquent(有口才的), I still can't see the logic of his argument(论点).

**concentration**
It requires total concentration when one is operating this machine.
The concentration of troops in this area shows open hostility(敌意).

**plaque**
The CAT scan showed that the plaque in the patient's brain decreased after treatment.
Proper brushing and flossing(用牙线) can  remove the plaque on your teeth.

**be aware** v.知道，意识到  be aware of the dog 意识到有狗狗(为了不踩到他们)
We should be aware of the traffic rules when we drive. That means we should be mindful(留心的、记住的) of them.
**beware** v.小心，提防（危险的人或物）   beware of the dog 小心恶犬
it means to be cautious or careful. When I hear "I need to beware,"I think of something potentially dangerous threatening or even scary that I need to watch out for.
When we drive, we should not only be aware of the traffic rules but we also need to beware of the police.

**mental gymnastics**  

* You're doing some exercise for the mind.
* it's an argument used to justify something that you are doing. So sometimes you have to think of creative ways to convince somebody else to believe something that may be isn't true.
* you're having to do mental gymnastics to try to create a story that sounds true.

# Ransomware

**damage control**
So now that you've fallen prey to ransomware,what can you do to regain control of your computer? First of all, don't hand over any money - the crooks may not keep their promises and may ask for more and more. Instead, disconnect from the Internet to keep the criminals from further access to your files, alert the authorities, and research the ransomware on a different device.

**Keeping ahead**
The best way to defeat ransomware is obviously early prevention by installing antivirus software(virus-killing programs) and backing up important files.
Common sense doesn't hurt either don't visit questionable websites or open attachments on strange emails. Variations of ransomware are growing increasingly lethal, such as this year's Jigsaw ransomware that uses the creepy puppet from the Saw movies as its mascot. It starts deleting your files after 60 minutes, erasing more and more as each hour goes by. With such harmful programs out there, it's important to change with the times by building up stronger software and security to keep our computers safe

How do you resolve conflicts?
I will approach this person directly and talk about what happened.
So you don't talk behind their back.

Do you ever get emotional? Why?

Neither of you has the authority to decide this issue.

You put your logic aside,and your emotions take over. And being emotional just intensifies the conflict. It looks like the conflict is being resolved.

I just concluded an advertising agreement with a well-known candy company.

I could very well thank a person without truly appreciating the value of what they've done.

appreciate表示对所做事的欣赏，thanks表示对人的感谢 两个并行不悖
